Given the time and budgetary constraints, we're hoping to articulate hunches (especially from collaborators in the field), learn about the perceived needs of a variety of user populations, build prototypes derived from those hunches, and test them qualitatitvely.</p></div><p>The kinds of research questions that we hope to answer at this point include the following:</p><ul><li>Are there categories of "content" which non-developers would enjoy using, making customized versions thereof, and distributing to their local social network?</li><li>What are the kinds of interactions that are most amenable to this kind of user-generated apps?</li><li>What are the affordances that make this kind of personal app customization easy or hard?
