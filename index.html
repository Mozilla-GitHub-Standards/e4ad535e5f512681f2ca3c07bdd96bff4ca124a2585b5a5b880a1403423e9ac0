These phones are different than the phones that drove adoption in the richer markets, and there are many questions as to whether the models that have worked in e.g. Europe and North America will work, whether thinking about adoption patterns, usage patterns, demand and supply ecosystems, distribution and monetization models, etc.</p><p>While we can expect the existing models to be applied globally and have definite success (especially as they adapt to feedback), we believe it is worth seeking innovations in the field of app authoring and distribution models in particular. By working with communities engaged in Mozilla's learning and technology communities, testing our approaches in the field, and working with partners who share our interest in new models of local content creation, we hope to to facilitate the creation of content by non-traditional participants in the mobile content ecosystem.</p><h1>How</h1><p>Please see our public <a href="goals">goals, <a href="approach">approach</a> and <a href="plan">plan</a> to understand the process we will use for this project.
