These phones are different than the phones that drove adoption in the richer markets, and there are many questions as to whether the models that have worked in e.g. Europe and North America will work, whether thinking about adoption patterns, usage patterns, demand and supply ecosystems, distribution and monetization models, etc.</p><h1>How</h1><p>Please see our public <a href="goals">goals, <a href="approach">approach</a> and <a href="plan">plan</a> to understand the process we will use for this project.
