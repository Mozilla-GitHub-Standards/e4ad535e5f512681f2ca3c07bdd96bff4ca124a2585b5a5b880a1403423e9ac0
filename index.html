These phones are different than the phones that drove adoption in the richer markets, and there are many questions as to whether the models that have worked in e.g. Europe and North America will work, whether thinking about adoption patterns, usage patterns, demand and supply ecosystems, distribution and monetization models, etc.</p><h1>How</h1><p>Please see our public <a href="approach">approach</a> and <a href="plan">plan</a> to understand the process we will use for this project.</p><h1>When</h1><p>This project is starting in June 2014, and is expected to continue until at least November 2015, at which point we will perform a high-level assessment.</p></section></body></html>
